For this project, I first refactored the HTML code to be more user friendly, using semantic HTML elements. I changed numerous "divs" to elements such as header, nav, main, section, article, and footer. 

Once seeing that changing these things did not affect the skeleton HTML skeleton, I began looking at the CSS stylesheet. 

Here, I examined the CSS code and looked for any parts that could be consolidated. I noticed that towards the end of the code, several classes used the same margin bottom and font size. I was able to add these properties and declarations to three existing classes, which left me able to remove the classes within the stylesheet that had only these declarations. For the hero image, I added a no repeat declaration to prevent the image from multiplying.  

The result is a an HTML code and a CSS code that renders the same results as the previous one, but is more legible.
